This is a convenience library with Elytron-related porcelain.

It can be used to retrieve clear-text passwords in case an Elytron credential 
store is required to be used for secrets that aren't used by JBoss.

It is tested with version 1.4.0.Final of the Elytron tool, which ships with 
JBoss EAP 7.2.6.0.
